This is the file for the abstracts of Nikolas Churik and Andrew Boudon.

Questions:

1. Where does scholiastic material overlap across multiple types of scholia?
2. How does material repeat across books within a manuscript?
3. Where does material overlap across the VenA and the Y.1.1?

3. Where does material repeat within a set of scholia?
4. Where do words get glossed in the interlinears?
5. Why do words get glossed when they do?
6. How does the context of the word within the text influence how it is glossed?
7. How do critical signs relate to the amount of material on a line?
8. How are formula pieces/patterns treated in the scholia?

How to approach and answer questions:

1. See what lines have multiple scholia on them.
2. Search (?) for words that are glossed multiple times.
3. See what lines have scholia in both VenA and Y.1.1.
4. Look for formulaic structures/lines/half-lines.
5.
